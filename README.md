# Puzzle_platformer

A UE5 Puzzle Platformer.

This is a 2D puzzle platformer project developed in **Unreal Engine 5**. This repository serves to document my learning and skill development process in game development.

## About The Project

This project was initiated as part of the Udemy course: "Become a game developer in 6 hours by creating an entire puzzle platformer in UE5!"(https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealengine5-make-your-first-game/). 
The course provided a solid foundation and the initial codebase, which includes all the core systems required for a complete game.

The current version (v0.1) is the completed project from the course. 
It includes a complete character controller (movement, sprinting, camera shake, 3D sounds), four finished puzzle levels, and a dynamic item collection system to open the exit.
It also features reusable Blueprints (moving platforms, traps, pressure plates, subtitle triggers) and a full suite of UI Widgets to manage the game flow: a main menu with level selection, a pause menu, a death screen, and a final end screen.

## Future Plans

This repository will be actively developed, as the initial course was just the first step. My goal is to move beyond the tutorial, refactor the code, add my own unique ideas, and transform this project into a polished, custom game for my portfolio.

Immediate plans include adding new gameplay mechanics (such as a double jump, dash, or new obstacle types), designing original levels with more complex puzzles, and general polishing of the UI/UX, optimization, and bug fixing.
